- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @kefrenJimenez13, an electonics engineer
- üëÄ This fresh engineer is intrested in both silicon devices design (analog and digital) and embedded sytems development.
- üå± I‚Äôm currently still learning and I am enthusiastic about sharing my knowledge and teach. Feel free to ask me anything
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm have experience in the following platforms:
             > FPGA's (Spartan 6/7) describing hardware modules with HDL.
             > ARM MCU's(STM32, NXP), ESP32, AVR programmed in low-level programming as assembler, high-level languages
               as C/C++/Python (BareMetal & HAL programming).
             > Implemented embedded systems running RTOS/Linux.
        In IC design, I have experience with the Cadence environment tools like Virtuoso, Genus, Innovus.
        I also use open-source tools like magic VLSI, NgSPICE, LTSPICE, Xscheme, OpenLane, and Icarus Verilog.
        In my projects, I've used hardware description languages (HDL) such as VHDL, Verilog, and SystemVerilog.

- ‚öíÔ∏è       During my internship in Digital IC Validation, I learned the SKILL language to perform automated simulation
        and verification of the devices I've designed.
